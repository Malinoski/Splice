This is a example of a framework for prehospital emergency system used for the [AToMS](http://www.hindawi.com/journals/ijta/2011/560209/) system.
In this example, the HTMLs used in "atoms2.0-Emer" and "atoms2.0-Esp" were used for AToMS purpose, but the remaining code can be used for other prehospital emergency systems.
